=Chapter 1 Introduction=
==Page 7 - Regular Expressions==
This was reported as Issue 5.

There was an error somewhere after final edition and printing. And an extra "A" slipped in to a code block:
{{{
A^\t+    Matches one or more Tab characters at the start of a string
}}}

should be

{{{
^\t+    Matches one or more Tab characters at the start of a string
}}}

=Chapter 2 HTML=
==Page 19 - History and overview==
This was reported as Issue 1.

A closing square bracket was mistakenly deleted during review:
<code language="html">
<![CDATA[
Here you can ...
]>
</code>

Should be
<code language="html">
<![CDATA[
Here you can ...
]]>
</code>

==Page 51 - Advanced markup obfuscation==
This was reported as Issue 2.

This is not an error by itself, but some people may have problem reproducing this.

<code language="html">
<!`[`if IE 8.0]>
<script>alert(1)</script>  // works on IE8
<!`[`endif]>
</code>

This code is supposed to work on Internet Explorer 8 mode. Depending on the doctype of the page, it could load your browser in other mode.

==Page 51 - Advanced markup obfuscation==
This was reported as Issue 3.

During edition some dashes were missed:

<code language=html>
<!-`[`if<img src=x onerror=alert(1)//]--> works! 
<b>000</b>
<!--`[`endif]->
</code>

should be

<code language=html>
<!--`[`if<img src=x onerror=alert(1)//]--> works! 
<b>000</b>
<!--`[`endif]-->
</code>

==Page 52 - Advanced markup obfuscation==
This was reported as Issue 4.

A closing angle bracket got lost during editing, and a comment dash is missing:

<code language=html>
<!--`[`if true && ><script>alert(1)</script]->
000
<!--`[`endif]->
</code>

should be

<code language=html>
<!--`[`if true && ><script>alert(1)</script>]-->
000
<!--`[`endif]-->
</code>
