Obfuscation of malicious code has allowed attackers to take one attack and create hundreds if not millions of variants that can try to evade your security measures. Web Application Obfuscation takes a look at common security tools, IDSs, IPSs, and WAFs from an attacker's perspective, allowing the reader to understand the shortcomings of their security systems. Find out how an attacker would bypass different types of security, how these very security controls introduce new types of vulnerabilities, and how to avoid these and strength your defenses. |
